Sure, here's an example Markdown code for a GitHub page:

```markdown
# My GitHub Page

Welcome to my GitHub page! Here you can find some of my latest projects:

## Project 1

This is a brief description of my first project. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/myusername/project1).

## Project 2

This is a brief description of my second project. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/myusername/project2).

## Contact Me

If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, you can reach me at myemail@example.com.

Thanks for visiting my page!
```

This example Markdown code creates a simple GitHub page with a header, a brief introduction, and a list of two projects with links to their respective GitHub repositories. Finally, it includes a section to contact the owner of the page. You can customize this Markdown code to fit your own needs and style.
